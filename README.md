# QAcademy Nurses Hub — README
*Last updated: April 2026*

## What This Is
QAcademy Nurses Hub is a web-based learning management system for nursing students in Ghana preparing for NMC licensure exams. It serves five programmes: RN, RM, RPHN, RMHN, and NACNAP.

## Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML / CSS / JS — no build step |
| Hosting | Cloudflare Pages |
| Database & Auth | Supabase (free tier) |
| Payments | Paystack — Cloudflare Worker (`payments-worker/`) |
| Emails | Resend API — Cloudflare Worker (`workers/email-worker/`) |
| Messaging | Built-in thread-based system (Supabase) |

No separate backend server. Everything is JAMstack. Workers are isolated to payments and emails only.

### Environments
| | Dev | Prod |
|--|-----|------|
| **Repo** | `mybackpacc-byte/qacademy-gamma` | `qacademynurseshub-svg/qacademy` |
| **Pages** | `qacademy-gamma.pages.dev` | `qacademy-bkf.pages.dev` |
| **Branch** | `main` | `production` → mirrors to prod repo |

`js/config.js` auto-detects dev vs prod by hostname. See `CLONING.md` for full environment details.

## Project Structure

The project is organised into two independent products under a shared root:

```
qacademy-gamma/
  mynmclicensure/          ← NMC Licensure product
    admin/                 ← 12 admin pages
    student/               ← 16 student pages
    runner/                ← 2 quiz runner pages
    register.html, subscribe.html, payment-confirmation.html, premium-prep.html
  myteacher/               ← Teacher Assess product
    admin/                 ← 2 admin pages
    teacher/               ← 9 teacher pages
    student/               ← 5 student pages
    register.html
  js/
    paths.js               ← CENTRAL PATH CONFIG — edit this to clone
    config.js              ← Environment config (auto-detects dev vs prod)
    guard.js               ← Auth & role guards
    auth.js                ← Auth utilities (hashing, fingerprint, event IDs)
    mynmclicensure-api.js  ← Licensure data layer
    myteacher-api.js       ← Teacher Assess data layer
  payments-worker/         ← Cloudflare Worker (payments)
  workers/email-worker/    ← Cloudflare Worker (transactional emails)
  db/                      ← Schema, RLS, migrations, prod setup scripts
  (root HTML)              ← login, forgot-password, reset-password, router, index
```

### Path Configuration — `js/paths.js`

All dynamic URLs are driven by a central config. **Never hardcode product paths in JS.** Always use the constants:

```js
const LICENSURE = {
  admin:   '/mynmclicensure/admin',
  student: '/mynmclicensure/student',
  runner:  '/mynmclicensure/runner',
};

const MYTEACHER = {
  admin:   '/myteacher/admin',
  teacher: '/myteacher/teacher',
  student: '/myteacher/student',
};
```

**Usage in JS:** `LICENSURE.student + '/dashboard.html'` or `` `${MYTEACHER.teacher}/classes.html` ``

**In static HTML `href` attributes** (where JS variables can't be used), use the full path: `href="/mynmclicensure/student/dashboard.html"`.

> **Why this matters:** Hardcoded paths break cloning. If you add a new page or link, use the config constants in any JS context. This ensures a new product can be created by changing 3 lines in `paths.js` instead of hunting through 60+ files. See `CLONING.md` section 0 for full cloning instructions.

---

## Key Conventions
- Supabase JS CDN uses `supabase` as global variable. Project uses `const db = supabase.createClient(...)` in `js/config.js`. All files reference `db`, never `supabase`.
- `.maybeSingle()` instead of `.single()` on queries where result might be empty.
- `js/mynmclicensure-api.js` is the licensure data layer. `js/myteacher-api.js` is the teacher assess data layer. Shared reads go in the relevant API file. Page-specific logic stays in the page file.
- When adding to an API file, provide only the new function block — never a full rewrite.
- Item IDs are globally unique and course-prefixed: `GP_001`, `RN_MED_001`, etc.
- **Never hardcode `/mynmclicensure/...` or `/myteacher/...` paths in JavaScript.** Always use `LICENSURE.x` or `MYTEACHER.x` from `js/paths.js`.

- **Slice 10: Dashboard Wiring** — Teacher dashboard (live stats, recent activity), Student dashboard (live stats, first-visit join overlay)
- **Slice 11: Library Picker** — Standalone full-screen page, course browser with filters, add to quiz draft, wired to quiz manager Library tab, edit-to-copy flow (LIB items save to personal bank with source tracking, original library untouched)
- **Integrity Hardening** — 12 fixes across 3 tiers (see Quiz Lifecycle Rules below)
- **Slice 12: Teacher Courses** — teacher_courses table, CRUD API, self-contained courses-panel.js component. course_id added to teacher_quizzes (nullable, subject kept as fallback)
- **Slice 13: Programmes & Cohorts** — teacher_programmes + teacher_cohorts tables, CRUD APIs, programmes-panel.js + cohorts-panel.js components. Academic Structure page with all three panels
- **Slice 14: Wiring** — Cohort dropdown on class creation (replaces programme/course text fields), class list grouped by cohort, course dropdown on quiz settings (replaces subject free-text), auto-suggested class titles from cohort + academic year + semester

### Profile Pages ✅
- **Student NMC Profile** (`student/profile.html`) — Personal details (name, phone, avatar), academic details (level, cohort), subscription status. Inline edit with save.
- **Teacher Profile** (`myteacher/teacher/profile.html`) — QAcademy account (name, phone, avatar, plan, status) + Organisation (name, tagline, region, logo). Inline edit with save.
- **Student Teacher Assess Profile** (`myteacher/student/profile.html`) — Account info (read-only) + per-class custom fields with completeness tracking. Editable custom fields with save.

### Class Join Approval ✅
- **Require approval toggle** — Teachers can enable "require approval to join" per class (create/edit modal)
- **Pending queue** — Students with pending status shown in member list with approve/reject buttons
- **Student UX** — Pending class cards (dashed border), appropriate messaging, blocked from class content until approved
- **Org identity on join** — Join flow shows teacher name, org name, and logo when entering a class code
- **Schema**: `teacher_classes.require_approval` (boolean), `teacher_class_members.status` supports `PENDING`/`REJECTED`

### Extended Class Metadata ✅
- **Optional fields** on `teacher_classes`: `description`, `programme`, `course`, `academic_year`, `semester`, `max_capacity`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `colour`, `cohort_id`
- **Teacher modal** — cohort dropdown (grouped by programme), academic year + semester free-text, settings, colour picker with 8 presets. Auto-suggested class title from cohort + academic year + semester
- **Teacher class cards** — colour accent border, programme subtitle, academic period chip, capacity counter, "Ended" badge, grouped by cohort in list

### Academic Structure ✅ (Slices 12–14)
- **Mental model:** Programme (the degree) → Cohort (the intake group) → Class (cohort + semester). Course (the subject) → Quiz. Courses link through quizzes, not classes.
- **3 new tables:** `teacher_programmes`, `teacher_cohorts`, `teacher_courses` — each with full CRUD API and RLS
- **Academic Structure page** (`academic-structure.html`) — three self-contained panel components side by side (programmes, cohorts, courses)
- **Components:** `programmes-panel.js`, `cohorts-panel.js`, `courses-panel.js` — reusable, container-agnostic, can be embedded on any page or inside a modal
- **Wiring:** Classes use cohort dropdown, quizzes use course dropdown. Backward compatible — old data with null cohort/course still works
- **Teacher detail panel** — description, info chips, date display, capacity slots
- **Student class cards** — colour accent, programme/course subtitle, academic period chip
- **Student join flow** — org card shows programme, course, description
- **Max capacity** — enforced on join (counts ACTIVE + PENDING members), returns "class is full" message

### MyLicensure Messaging ✅ (v2)

Thread-based messaging system between admin and students.

**Schema:** `messages_threads` + `messages` tables in Supabase. Thread reuse for general/course contexts, always new for question context. `ref_text` column stores human-readable question reference for question context threads.

**Student side** (`student/messages.html`):
- Split-pane inbox with refined chat bubbles, initials avatars, grouped messages, date dividers
- Deep-link from quiz runners and course page, optimistic send, Supabase Realtime
- Question threads show persistent ref card with formatted question text, options, and student's answer
- Mobile-responsive with thread list / conversation toggle

**Admin side** (`admin/messages.html`):
- Flat feed layout (Intercom-style) with accent left-border on admin messages
- 4 filters: search (name, email, question text), context type, status, unread
- **New Thread modal**: student search with manual user_id fallback, context-aware (general/course), multi-select course picker dynamically loaded from student's entitled courses, creates one thread per selected course
- **Bulk Send modal**: 5 multi-select pill picker scopes (programme, level, cohort, subscription kind, course entitlement), live preview count, confirmation step
- Close/reopen threads with inline banner
- Question threads show ref card with question_id, formatted question text, and admin guidance

**Quiz runner integration** (`runner/instant.html`, `runner/timed.html`):
- "Send feedback" button builds rich `ref_text` via `buildFriendlyRefText()`: course name, question position, topic, full stem, all options as displayed, student's current answer
- Correct answer deliberately excluded to prevent mid-quiz leaks
- `ref_text` stored on thread for persistent display and admin searchability

**API** (`js/api.js`):
- 14 functions: thread CRUD, message send/fetch, unread counts, recipient resolution, bulk send
- `ensureThread()` stores `ref_text` on thread creation
- `resolveRecipients()` supports array-based scope filters (AND across fields, OR within)
- Unread count badge on Messages nav link in both sidebars via `guard.js`

**Entry points:**
| Entry point | Context type | Pre-filled data |
|---|---|---|
| `runner/instant.html` → "Send feedback" | `question` | course_id, quiz_id, attempt_id, item_id, rich ref_text |
| `runner/timed.html` → "Send feedback" | `question` | course_id, quiz_id, attempt_id, item_id, rich ref_text |
| `student/course.html` → "Message us" | `course` | course_id |
| `student/messages.html` → "+ New" | `general` | — |
| `admin/messages.html` → "New Thread" | `general` / `course` | selected student, multi-select courses |
| `admin/messages.html` → "Bulk Send" | `general` / `course` | scoped recipients via 5 pill pickers |

## admin/subscriptions.html — Behaviour Notes
- **Sync Status button:** manually flips `ACTIVE → EXPIRED` where `expires_utc < now()`. One direction only. Run on each admin visit to keep status column truthful. Required because Supabase free tier has no pg_cron for scheduled jobs.
- **Grant Subscription in panel:** appears on ALL subscription statuses (not just expired/cancelled). Pre-fills the student automatically via `openGrantForUser(userId, name, email)`.

---

## Question Bank — CSV Import Rules
1. 24 columns in fixed order — always download the template from the page
2. `question_type`: MCQ | TF | SATA (case sensitive)
3. `stem` and `correct` are required — rows missing either are skipped
4. At least `option_a` and `option_b` must be filled
5. `correct`: single letter for MCQ/TF (e.g. `b`), quoted comma-separated for SATA (e.g. `"a,c,e"`)
6. `item_id` can be blank — auto-generated on import
7. Re-importing same `item_id` updates the row, does not duplicate (upsert)
8. `shuffle_options`: `true` for MCQ/SATA, `false` for TF
9. Export from Google Sheets or Excel as CSV — they handle quoting automatically

---

## Config Table
Every key is a system key referenced by platform code. Never rename or delete unless certain nothing depends on it.

| Key | Value | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `runner_questions_per_page` | `2` | Questions per page in both runners |
| `runner_autosave_interval_sec` | `60` | Autosave frequency in runners (seconds) |
| `builder_max_questions` | `50` | Max questions student can request in builder |
| `builder_default_questions` | `20` | Default question count in builder |
| `builder_minutes_per_question` | `1` | Time estimate per question in builder |

## Quiz Lifecycle Rules

### State Machine
```
DRAFT ──publish──▶ PUBLISHED ──archive──▶ ARCHIVED
  │                                          ▲
  └────────────archive───────────────────────┘
```
No unpublish. No unarchive. Clone creates a new DRAFT from any state.

### Field Mutability After Publish

| Category | Fields | DRAFT | PUBLISHED | ARCHIVED |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Integrity (scoring)** | `sata_scoring_policy`, `duration_minutes`, `shuffle_questions`, `shuffle_options`, `custom_fields_json`, `draft_items_json` | ✏️ Editable | 🔒 Locked | 🔒 Locked |
| **Administrative** | `title`, `subject`, `max_attempts`, `open_at`, `close_at` | ✏️ Editable | ✏️ Editable | 🔒 Locked |
| **Display & Policy** | `results_release_policy`, `show_results`, `show_review`, `score_display_policy`, `pass_threshold_pct`, `grade_bands_json` | ✏️ Editable | ✏️ Editable | ✏️ Editable |
| **Access** | `access_code` | ✏️ Editable | 🔒 Locked | 🔒 Locked |

**Why?** Integrity fields affect scoring — changing them mid-flight would make some students' scores invalid. Administrative fields are schedule/logistics. Display/policy fields only affect how results are shown, not how scores are calculated.

### Snapshots (frozen at submit time)
These values are captured from the live quiz onto each attempt's `score_json` at submission, so retroactive teacher changes don't corrupt historical results:
- `pass_threshold_pct`, `sata_scoring_policy`
- `results_release_policy`, `show_review`, `show_results`, `results_released`, `close_at`
- `grading_policy`, `grade_bands_json`, `score_display_policy` (stored as separate columns on attempt)

### Safety Guards
- **Archive blocked** while students have IN_PROGRESS attempts
- **Concurrency guard** prevents double-click from creating duplicate attempts
- **Date validation** enforced: `close_at > open_at`, `AFTER_CLOSE` requires `close_at`
- **Draft deduplication** at publish time (server-side)
- **Release Results** works on both PUBLISHED and ARCHIVED quizzes (prevents permanent lock)

- Licensure student pages (`mynmclicensure/student/*`) — guarded by sidebar auth check
- Wrong role → redirected to `/router.html`; no session → redirected to `/login`

## Device Sessions
Concurrent login control limits each user to 2 active device sessions. On login, a session row is created in the `sessions` table with a 7-day expiry. If a 3rd login occurs, the oldest session is automatically deactivated. On every page load, `guardPage()` verifies the session is still active via `verifySession()`. On logout, `deactivateCurrentSession()` marks the session inactive. Session ID is stored in `localStorage` as `qa_session_id`.

## Login Rate Limiting
Every login attempt (success or failure) is logged to the `auth_events` table via the `log_auth_event` RPC. Before each login, `check_login_rate_limit` checks recent failures. Thresholds: 5 failures in 10 minutes → 10-min block, 10 failures in 24 hours → 24-hr block. Tracked per email and per device fingerprint. Auth utilities (hashing, fingerprint, event IDs) are in `js/auth.js`. Fail-open design: if the rate limit check errors, login proceeds normally.

## RLS
All 37 tables now have proper role-based RLS policies defined in `db/rls.sql`. Two helper functions bypass RLS safely:
- `auth_user_role()` — returns current user's role (SECURITY DEFINER)
- `auth_user_id()` — returns current user's user_id (SECURITY DEFINER)

Policy groups: public-read (programs), logged-in read (courses, products, config, quizzes, items, announcements), student-owned (attempts, offline_packs, subscriptions, user_notice_state), teacher-owned (bank_items, classes, quizzes, profiles), shared teacher↔student (class_members, quiz_attempts), admin-only (payments), messaging (thread ownership).

See `db/rls.sql` for the complete policy definitions.

## XSS Hardening
Four vulnerable locations patched (innerHTML with user-controlled data):
- `js/myteacher-teacher-nav.js` — user chip
- `js/myteacher-student-nav.js` — user chip
- `js/mynmclicensure-student-sidebar.js` — avatar rendering
- `router.html` — resubmit button onclick

New shared helpers in `js/utils.js`: `safeText()` and `safeAvatar()`. All new UI that displays user data must use these instead of innerHTML.
